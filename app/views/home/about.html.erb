      <p>This site is intended for all ages. Come on, I'm sure you have a few minutes during the day to have some fun!</p>

      <h2>Education</h2>
      <div><i class="fa fa-file-code-o"></i></div>
      <p>The second component of this site is its educational purpose. Learning to code gave me the ability to turn silly ideas into a functional website. For any non-developers, I hope the code snippet will encourage you to explore programming!</p>

      <p>Perhaps FruitFace will make its way through a <%= link_to "Foodini", "http://www.cnn.com/2014/11/06/tech/innovation/foodini-machine-print-food/" %> one day. In the meantime, hopefully some time spent here will remind you to consume your fruits!</p>
